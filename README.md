NI SNAPS is a Blender add-on created to streamline building, organizing, and exporting game-ready assets — especially for Nifty Island. It lets you create and manage “snap” empties on meshes, batch-assign materials, quickly resize/relink textures, tidy collections, and export clean GLB files so your assets drop into Nifty Island with max effect and minimal fuss. 

Can be leveraged to use with other games that require asset upload with specific references.


## Install (Blender)



1. Download the release ZIP (this one) < probs already done this!!
2. In Blender: Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → Install 
3. Choose the downloaded ZIP → enable **NI SNAPS** 
   

## Usage



* Press N to open the N-Panel → NI SNAPS.
* Creation Settings — Set snap name prefix, default empty size, and root collection.
* Asset Library — Point to asset folders and quickly append/import assets.
* Assign Materials — Pick object slots and apply saved material groups.
* Texture Resize — See this object’s textures; pick targets; batch-resize/relink.
* Set Object Origin — Quickly set origin (to snap, bounds center, or 3D cursor).
* Create Snaps — Generate/edit snap empties on the mesh; control size/naming; reassign to active.
* Cleanup — Remove stray/unused snaps, normalize names, tidy collections.
* Export Tools (GLB) — Batch export with optional nearby meshes and “hide after export”; Unhide All Exported restores visibility.

  

## Starter file (optional)



Use the NI\_SNAPS\_starter.blend inside unzipped folder - the blend file contains a basic snappable asset library which is essential for builders including walls, roof, floor, stairs and 2D/3D slots... there is also a collection of handy blender tricks for noobs (soon to be legends).
